The code achieves efficient topology optimization of 3D cantilever beams, and the boundaries of the optimization results are expressed smoothly.

The theory of this code can be found in "An efficient coupling reduction model-based evolutionary topology optimization method", 

and we thank "On multigrid-CG for efficient topology optimization" for open-sourcing the MGCG code.
